Six years ago, in August 2010, I asked the question 
Have We Reached The Software Patent Tipping Point?
Oracle sued Google over a series of Java-related patents 
they got when they acquired Sun.
My favorite line from the whole thing was James Gosling’s 
(who was one of the authors of one of the original patents and a key
 creator of Java) when he wrote The shit finally hits the fan.
“The shit finally hits the fan…. Thursday August 12, 2010

Oracle finally filed a patent lawsuit against Google. Not a big surprise.
 During the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle where we were 
 being grilled about the patent situation between Sun and Google, we 
 could see the Oracle lawyer’s eyes sparkle. Filing patent suits was 
 never in Sun’s genetic code. Alas…. 
I hope to avoid getting dragged into the fray: they only picked one of my 
patents (RE38,104) to sue over.”
Oracle also got copyrights to the Java APIs. Remember, Java was 
theoretically Open Source, but like so many things in our world when 
lawyers get involved “it’s complicated.” Stack Exchange regularly has 
commentary about this. See Is Java free/open source or not? and Is java 
an open source programming language?

It’s not as messy as the Greek debt crisis but directionally similar. And 
it’s far from over. I was hoping the Supreme Court would take this on and 
help put an important issue around copyright to bed. But the Supremes 
passed, deferring to the need for a lower court to rule on the appeal.
